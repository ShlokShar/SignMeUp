# SignMeUp - The ASL Subtitle

SignMeUp bridges the gap for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers by turning English captions into ASL subtitles, making stories, lessons, and conversations truly accessible to everyone.

## What it does
A user begins by uploading an MP4 video, after which SignMeUp extracts the audio and transcribes it into text using OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model. The transcribed text is then passed through our an English to ASL translation pipeline, which reformats the English into a sequence of ASL signs. Each word in the sequence is matched against entries in the ASL-LEX database to retrieve corresponding sign images. Finally, these images are overlaid on top of the video, producing ASL subtitles that play alongside the original content.
