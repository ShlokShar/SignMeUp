Here's what I thought he was joking.  Could it mean what contracts decide?  But then I started reading.  What is this?  Well, as you know, we had some new investors that have come.  What is this?  What's this?  What's this?  Mark?  Mark?  He's wired in.  Sorry?  He's wired in.  Is he?  Yes.  How about now?  He's still wired in?  That's a security.  You wish you 24 million new shares of stock?  You were told that if no investors came.  How much of your shares diluted? How much for his?  What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to?  It wasn't.  What was Mr. Moscow's ownership share diluted down to?  It wasn't.  What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to?  It wasn't.  What was Peter Teele's ownership share diluted down to?  It wasn't.  And what was your ownership share diluted down to?  0.03%.  You signed the papers.  You set me up.  You're going to blame me because you were the business head of the company.  And you made a bad business deal with your own company.  He's going to be like, I'm not a part of Facebook.  I won't be like you're not a part of Facebook. You're not a part of Facebook.  My name's on the mast head.  You might want to check again.  Spare as I froze the account.  You think we were going to let you parade around in your ridiculous suits.  Pretending you were running the same thing.  I'm afraid my promise and the cleaners along with my hoodie and my fucking flip flops.  You pretentious douchebag.  Security's here. You'll be leaving now.  I'm not citing those papers.  We will get the signature.  Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix.  You.  You did it. I knew you did it. You planted that story about the chicken.  I didn't plant the story about the chicken.  Let's see talking about it.  Yeah, me accused of animal cruelty.  Seriously, what the hell's the chicken?  And I'll bet what you hated the most.  You said they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook.  Which I am. You better lawyer op asshole.  Because I'm not coming back for 30%.  I'm coming back for everything.  Get him out of here.  It's okay, I won't.  Hang on.  I almost forgot.  As you're $19,000, I wouldn't cash it though.  I drew it on the account you froze.  I like sending next to you, Sean.  Makes me look so tough.
